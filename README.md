# Data-Visualization-Netflix-Stock-Profile

Thanks to Codeacademy for the amazing project!

The objectif of here is to practice data visualization and analyze, prepare and plot data with conda installation packages such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and jupyter.
With the help of Yahoo's financial database, the visualizations are:

 1. The distribution of Netflix's stock prices for 2017
 2. Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters
 3. The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017
 4. A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017 
 
The plots are uploaded as .png files if you wish to take a look at them. Also, you can find the .py as well as the .csv files in the repo.
For presentation purposes, I have uploaded at .ppt file to discuss about the visualizations.
 
Enjoy!
